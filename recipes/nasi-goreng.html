        Fried rice is a versatile dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with oil, typically mixed with ingredients like
        eggs, vegetables, and meat or seafood.
        It is known for its savory flavor, slightly crispy texture, and the way each grain of rice stays separate when
        cooked properly. Soy sauce and aromatics such as garlic, onions, or scallions are often added to enhance its
        taste.

    <p>Originating in East Asia, fried rice developed as a practical way to use leftover rice and ingredients, reducing
        waste while creating a satisfying meal.
        Today, it has countless regional variations around the world, adapting to local flavors and preferences while
        remaining a quick, comforting, and widely loved dish.
